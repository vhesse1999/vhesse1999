Hi, my name is Valeria Hesse and here is some more information about me!

I graduated from Johns Hopkins University, where I majored in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, and also minored in Business, and Entrepreneurship and Management. 

I am currently a Customer Success Account Manager at Microsoft, where I help our customers reach their business outcomes by orchestrating and collaborating with various resources, removing blockers, working with a dedicated account team, and acting as their advocate within Microsoft. 

I am passionate about learning, and am specifically interested in data science, and machine learning. I am currently taking the Data Camp Data Scientist with Python track and am loving it so far! I am also passionate about sustainability, technology, mental health, and empowering the Latine community.

My top 5 strengths are communication, analytical, consistency, learner, and discipline. 

In my free time, I enjoy reading, listening to podcasts, travelling, exercising, being outdoors, learning, meeting new people, and spending time with friends and family.
